Brisk walking is an excellent form of exercise for elderly individuals. It helps improve cardiovascular health, enhances mood, and strengthens bones and muscles. Start by choosing a safe, flat route. Wear comfortable shoes and clothing. Begin with a warm-up: walk slowly for five minutes to prepare your muscles. Gradually increase your pace to a brisk walk, which means walking fast enough to increase your heart rate but still being able to talk comfortably. Aim for at least 30 minutes, five times a week. Remember to cool down by walking slowly for another five minutes at the end.
