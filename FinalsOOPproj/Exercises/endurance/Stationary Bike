Using a stationary bike is a great low-impact exercise that strengthens leg muscles and improves cardiovascular health. Adjust the bike seat to a comfortable height where your knees are slightly bent when the pedals are at the lowest point. Start with a five-minute warm-up by pedaling slowly. Gradually increase your pace to a moderate intensity where you feel a slight increase in your breathing rate. Aim to cycle for 20-30 minutes, adjusting the resistance as needed. End with a five-minute cool-down by pedaling slowly again. Stationary biking can be done while watching TV or listening to music, making it an enjoyable exercise.
