Swimming is a low-impact exercise that’s gentle on the joints, making it ideal for seniors. It improves cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and flexibility. Begin with a warm-up by swimming slowly for five minutes. Then, increase your pace gradually. Choose a stroke that you find comfortable, like the breaststroke or backstroke. Aim to swim for 20-30 minutes, adjusting the duration based on your fitness level. Cool down by swimming slowly again for five minutes. Swimming is also a great way to socialize if you join a water aerobics class or swim with friends.
