Gardening is a delightful way to stay active and enjoy the outdoors. It helps with strength, flexibility, and endurance. Begin with light activities like weeding or pruning for a few minutes to warm up. Gradually move to more vigorous tasks such as digging or raking. Remember to use proper techniques to avoid strain: bend your knees when lifting, and use tools to minimize bending and reaching. Aim for 30-45 minutes of gardening, taking breaks as needed. Gardening not only benefits physical health but also mental well-being by providing a sense of accomplishment and connection to nature.
