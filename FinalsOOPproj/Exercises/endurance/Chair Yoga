Chair yoga is a gentle form of yoga that can be performed while sitting or using a chair for support. It improves flexibility, strength, and balance. Start by sitting comfortably on a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Begin with deep breathing exercises to relax. Perform simple stretches like seated forward bends, gentle twists, and leg lifts. Focus on maintaining good posture and moving slowly. Aim to practice chair yoga for 20-30 minutes. Chair yoga is particularly beneficial for those with limited mobility and can be done almost anywhere, making it a convenient option.
