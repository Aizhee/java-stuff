Pilates focuses on strengthening the core muscles, improving flexibility, and enhancing posture. For seniors, Pilates can be adapted to any fitness level. Begin with simple exercises on a mat, such as leg lifts or seated stretches. Use a Pilates band or small weights for added resistance if comfortable. Aim to practice Pilates for 20-30 minutes, focusing on slow, controlled movements and breathing. Always listen to your body and avoid any movements that cause discomfort. Joining a Pilates class specifically designed for seniors can provide guidance and ensure proper technique.
