Using an elliptical trainer provides a full-body workout that’s easy on the joints. It improves cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and coordination. Start with a five-minute warm-up at a low resistance and slow pace. Gradually increase the resistance and pace to a moderate intensity where you feel a noticeable increase in your heart rate and breathing. Aim to use the elliptical for 20-30 minutes, maintaining good posture and engaging your core muscles. End with a five-minute cool-down by reducing the resistance and pace. The elliptical trainer allows you to exercise indoors, making it convenient in any weather.
