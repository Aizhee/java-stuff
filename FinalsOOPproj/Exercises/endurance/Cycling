Cycling is an excellent way to improve cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and joint mobility. Choose a comfortable bike and ensure the seat is adjusted to the proper height. Start with a five-minute warm-up by cycling slowly. Gradually increase your pace to a moderate intensity, where you feel a slight increase in your breathing rate. Aim to cycle for 30-45 minutes, exploring different routes to keep the activity enjoyable. Remember to wear a helmet and follow safety rules if cycling outdoors. Cycling can also be done on a stationary bike indoors for convenience and safety.
