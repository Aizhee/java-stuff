Chair squats are an excellent exercise for strengthening the lower body muscles, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Stand in front of a sturdy chair with feet hip-width apart. Lower your body as if sitting back into the chair, keeping knees behind toes. Hover over the chair briefly, then return to standing. Repeat for 10-12 reps, engaging core muscles for stability.
