Chair dips are an effective exercise for targeting the muscles in the triceps and shoulders. Sit on the edge of a sturdy chair with hands gripping the edge beside hips. Slide off the chair and lower your body until elbows are bent at about 90 degrees. Push back up to starting position. Repeat for 5-10 reps, adjusting difficulty by changing how far you lower.
