Lunges are effective for targeting multiple lower body muscles, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Stand tall with feet together. Take a big step forward with one foot and lower your body until both knees form 90-degree angles. Keep front knee aligned with ankle and back knee close to the ground. Push back to starting position. Repeat for 10-12 reps on each leg, alternating sides.
