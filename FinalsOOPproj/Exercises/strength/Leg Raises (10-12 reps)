Leg raises are beneficial for strengthening the muscles in the lower abdomen and improving hip stability. Sit tall in a chair with feet flat on the floor. Lift one leg straight out in front of you, keeping it parallel to the ground. Hold for a moment, then lower with control. Repeat for 10-12 reps on each leg.
