Standing leg raises are an excellent exercise for strengthening the muscles in the hips and thighs, which are crucial for maintaining balance and stability. This exercise involves lifting one leg to the side while keeping your toes pointed forward, engaging the muscles in your standing leg and core. Regular practice of standing leg raises can improve your ability to balance on one leg, which is essential for many daily activities. This exercise also helps to enhance lower body strength, making movements such as walking and climbing stairs easier and safer.

• Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart and hands on your hips or holding onto a chair for support.
• Lift your right leg straight out to the side as high as is comfortable, keeping your toes pointed forward.
• Lower your leg back to the starting position.
• Repeat for 10-12 reps, then switch legs.
