Step-ups are an excellent exercise for strengthening the legs and improving balance. This exercise mimics the action of climbing stairs and targets the muscles in the thighs, hips, and calves. By regularly performing step-ups, you can enhance your lower body strength and stability, which are essential for maintaining independence in daily activities. Step-ups also improve cardiovascular fitness and can be easily adjusted in intensity to match your fitness level, making them a versatile addition to your exercise routine.

• Stand in front of a sturdy step or platform.
• Step up with your right foot, bringing your left foot up to meet it.
• Step back down with your right foot, then your left.
• Repeat for 5-10 reps on each leg, alternating the lead leg.
