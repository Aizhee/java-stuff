The one-leg stand is a simple yet highly effective exercise for improving balance and leg strength. By lifting one foot off the ground and balancing on the other leg, you engage the stabilizing muscles in your standing leg and core. This exercise helps to enhance your ability to maintain stability on one leg, which is important for preventing falls and performing everyday activities. Practicing the one-leg stand regularly can significantly improve your balance and confidence in your movements, making it an essential part of any fitness routine for older adults.

• Stand tall with your feet together.
• Lift your right foot off the ground, balancing on your left leg.
• Hold the position for 20-30 seconds, using a chair or wall for support if needed.
• Lower your right foot and repeat on the left leg.
