Tree Pose is a classic yoga posture that offers multiple benefits, including improved balance, strengthened leg muscles, and enhanced concentration. Standing on one leg challenges your balance and engages the muscles in your standing leg and core, promoting stability. Additionally, bringing your hands together in front of your chest in a prayer position helps improve focus and mental clarity. Practicing Tree Pose regularly can contribute to better overall stability and reduce the risk of falls, making it an excellent exercise for older adults looking to maintain their balance and strength.

• Stand tall with your feet together and hands at your sides.
• Shift your weight onto your left foot.
• Bend your right knee and place the sole of your right foot on your left inner thigh or calf (avoid the knee).
• Bring your hands together in front of your chest in a prayer position.
• Hold the pose for 20-30 seconds, then switch legs.
