Circular arm swings are an effective exercise for improving shoulder mobility and flexibility. This exercise involves moving your arms in circular motions, which helps lubricate the shoulder joints and increase the range of motion. Regularly performing circular arm swings can prevent shoulder stiffness and improve overall arm function, making it easier to perform daily tasks that involve reaching and lifting. This simple exercise can be done anywhere and is an excellent way to keep your shoulders healthy and flexible.

• Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms extended to the sides at shoulder height.
• Swing your arms in small circular motions, gradually increasing the size of the circles.
• Repeat for 10 circles in one direction, then switch to the opposite direction.
