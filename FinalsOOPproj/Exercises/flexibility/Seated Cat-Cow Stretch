The seated Cat-Cow stretch is a highly effective exercise for improving spinal flexibility and relieving back tension. This gentle movement sequence helps to enhance the mobility of the spine, making it more flexible and resilient. Additionally, it targets the muscles along the spine, promoting relaxation and reducing stiffness. To perform the seated Cat-Cow stretch, sit on a chair with your feet flat on the floor and your hands resting on your knees.

Inhale deeply, arching your back and lifting your chest and tailbone towards the ceiling to enter Cow pose. This movement opens up the chest and stretches the front of the body. Exhale, rounding your spine and tucking your chin towards your chest to enter Cat pose. This movement stretches the back of the body and releases tension in the lower back. Repeat this sequence for several breaths, moving fluidly between Cat and Cow poses.

Incorporating the seated Cat-Cow stretch into your daily routine can help improve spinal mobility, reduce back pain, and promote overall spinal health. This exercise is gentle and accessible, making it suitable for individuals of all fitness levels.
