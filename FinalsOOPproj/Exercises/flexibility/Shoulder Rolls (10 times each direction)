Shoulder rolls help release tension and improve mobility in the shoulders. This exercise is ideal for individuals who experience stiffness or discomfort in the shoulder area due to poor posture or prolonged periods of inactivity. To perform shoulder rolls, stand tall with your arms relaxed at your sides.

Begin by rolling your shoulders forward in a circular motion, making big circles with your shoulders. Focus on smooth, controlled movements to fully engage the shoulder muscles. Repeat this motion for 10 times, then reverse the direction and roll your shoulders backward for another 10 times. This balanced approach helps ensure that both the front and back shoulder muscles are equally worked.

Incorporating shoulder rolls into your routine can help maintain shoulder flexibility, reduce muscle tension, and improve overall shoulder health. This exercise is simple and effective, making it an excellent addition to your daily routine.
