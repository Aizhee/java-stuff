Cat-Cow pose is a dynamic exercise that helps improve spinal flexibility and relieve tension in the back. This yoga-inspired movement sequence gently stretches and mobilizes the spine, making it an excellent choice for warm-ups or as part of a regular stretching routine. To perform Cat-Cow pose, start on your hands and knees with your wrists under your shoulders and knees under your hips.

Inhale deeply, arching your back and lifting your chest and tailbone towards the ceiling to enter Cow pose. This movement opens up the chest and stretches the front of the body. Exhale, rounding your spine and tucking your chin towards your chest to enter Cat pose. This movement stretches the back of the body and releases tension in the lower back. Repeat this sequence for several breaths, moving fluidly between Cat and Cow poses.

Incorporating Cat-Cow pose into your daily routine can help improve spinal mobility, reduce back pain, and promote overall spinal health. This exercise is gentle and accessible, making it suitable for individuals of all fitness levels.
