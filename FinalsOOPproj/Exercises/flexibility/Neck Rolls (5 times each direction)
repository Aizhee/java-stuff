Neck rolls help release tension in the neck and improve range of motion. This exercise is particularly beneficial for individuals who experience stiffness or discomfort due to prolonged periods of sitting or poor posture. Performing neck rolls can also help alleviate stress and reduce the risk of tension headaches. To perform neck rolls, start by sitting or standing tall with your shoulders relaxed.

Begin by slowly lowering your chin towards your chest, feeling a gentle stretch along the back of your neck. Gradually roll your head to one side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder. Continue rolling your head back, lifting your chin slightly as you move your head to the other side, completing a full circle. Ensure the movement is slow and controlled to avoid any sudden jerks. Repeat this motion for 5 times in one direction, then reverse the direction and repeat for another 5 times.

Incorporating neck rolls into your daily routine can help maintain neck flexibility and reduce muscle tension, contributing to overall neck health. This exercise is easy to perform and can be done almost anywhere, making it an ideal addition to your flexibility and relaxation regimen.
