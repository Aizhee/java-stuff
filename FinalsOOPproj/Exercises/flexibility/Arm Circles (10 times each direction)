Arm circles are an excellent exercise for enhancing shoulder mobility and flexibility, which are crucial for maintaining a healthy range of motion and preventing shoulder injuries. This simple yet effective movement helps to warm up the shoulder joints and muscles, making it ideal for both pre-workout routines and as part of a daily flexibility regimen. To perform arm circles, start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart to provide a stable base. Extend your arms out to the sides at shoulder height, ensuring they are parallel to the ground.

Begin by making small circular motions with your arms, focusing on controlled movements. Gradually increase the size of the circles to engage more of the shoulder muscles and joints. This gradual increase in circle size helps to progressively stretch and strengthen the shoulder area. Perform the arm circles for 10 repetitions in one direction, then reverse the direction and repeat for another 10 repetitions. This balanced approach ensures that both the anterior and posterior muscles of the shoulder are equally worked, promoting overall shoulder health and functionality.

Incorporating arm circles into your exercise routine can significantly benefit your shoulder's range of motion and flexibility, aiding in daily activities that require overhead movements, lifting, or reaching. Whether you're preparing for a more intense workout or simply looking to improve your shoulder flexibility, arm circles are a versatile and accessible exercise that can be performed almost anywhere, without the need for equipment.

• Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and arms extended to the sides at shoulder height.
• Make small circular motions with your arms, gradually increasing the size of the circles.
• Repeat for 10 times in each direction.
