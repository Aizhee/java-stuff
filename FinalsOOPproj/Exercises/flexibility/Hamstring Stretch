The hamstring stretch targets the muscles at the back of the thighs, which are crucial for maintaining lower body flexibility and preventing injuries. Stretching the hamstrings can also alleviate lower back pain and improve posture. To perform the hamstring stretch, sit on the edge of a chair with one leg extended in front and heel on the ground. Ensure your other foot is flat on the floor for stability.

Keep your back straight and hinge forward from the hips, reaching towards your toes. Avoid rounding your back to maximize the stretch in the hamstrings. You should feel a gentle stretch along the back of your extended leg. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply to relax into the stretch. After holding the stretch, switch legs and repeat the process.

Regularly performing the hamstring stretch can improve your flexibility, reduce muscle tightness, and support better movement mechanics during physical activities. This stretch is particularly beneficial for individuals who sit for extended periods, as it counteracts the negative effects of prolonged sitting.

• Sit on the edge of a chair with one leg extended in front and heel on the ground.
• Keep the back straight and hinge forward from the hips until you feel a gentle stretch in the back of the thigh.
• Hold for 20-30 seconds, then switch legs.
