Wrist and ankle rotations help improve joint mobility and flexibility, which are essential for maintaining overall joint health and preventing injuries. These exercises are particularly beneficial for individuals who experience stiffness or discomfort in the wrists and ankles. To perform wrist and ankle rotations, sit or stand comfortably with your arms extended in front of you and your legs extended in front or feet flat on the ground.

Rotate your wrists and ankles in circular motions, first in one direction, then in the opposite direction. Ensure the movements are slow and controlled to fully engage the joint muscles. Repeat this motion for several repetitions, focusing on smooth, continuous movements.

Incorporating wrist and ankle rotations into your routine can help maintain joint flexibility, reduce stiffness, and improve overall joint health. These exercises are simple and effective, making them an excellent addition to any flexibility routine.
