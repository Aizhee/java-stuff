The chest stretch opens up the front of the chest and shoulders, which is especially beneficial for individuals who spend long hours hunched over a desk or computer. Stretching the chest muscles can improve posture, alleviate upper back and neck pain, and enhance breathing. To perform the chest stretch, stand tall with your feet hip-width apart.

Clasp your hands behind your back and straighten your arms. Lift your arms slightly and gently squeeze your shoulder blades together. You should feel a stretch across the front of your chest and shoulders. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply to enhance the stretch. After holding the stretch, release your hands and relax.

Incorporating the chest stretch into your routine can help counteract the effects of prolonged sitting and poor posture, promoting better alignment and overall upper body flexibility. This stretch is simple and effective, making it an excellent addition to any flexibility routine.
