The seated spinal twist stretches the spine, shoulders, and hips, promoting flexibility and relieving tension. This exercise is particularly beneficial for improving spinal mobility and reducing discomfort in the lower back and hips. To perform the seated spinal twist, sit tall in a chair with your feet flat on the floor.

Place one hand on the opposite knee and the other hand on the back of the chair. Inhale deeply, lengthening your spine, and then exhale as you twist your torso towards the back of the chair. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply to enhance the stretch. After holding the stretch, switch sides and repeat the process.

Incorporating the seated spinal twist into your routine can help improve your flexibility, reduce muscle tightness, and support better movement mechanics. This stretch is gentle and accessible, making it suitable for individuals of all fitness levels.
