The seated forward bend stretches the lower back, hamstrings, and calves, promoting flexibility and relaxation. This stretch can help alleviate lower back pain and improve overall flexibility in the posterior chain. To perform the seated forward bend, sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you and your feet flexed.

Inhale deeply, lengthening your spine, and then exhale as you hinge forward from your hips, reaching towards your toes. Aim to keep your back as straight as possible to maximize the stretch in your hamstrings and lower back. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply to relax into the stretch. You can adjust the intensity by reaching further forward or slightly bending your knees.

Regularly practicing the seated forward bend can improve your flexibility, reduce muscle tightness, and support better movement mechanics. This stretch is particularly beneficial for individuals who experience tightness in the lower back or hamstrings.
