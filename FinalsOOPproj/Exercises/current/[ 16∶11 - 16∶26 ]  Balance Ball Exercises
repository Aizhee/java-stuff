Balance ball exercises are great for improving core strength and stability, which are crucial for overall balance and coordination. Using a stability ball requires engaging your core muscles to maintain balance, which can help improve posture and prevent lower back pain. Balance ball exercises can be varied to target different muscle groups and increase the challenge as your stability improves. These exercises are fun and effective, making them an excellent way to enhance your physical fitness and balance.

• Sit on a stability ball with your feet flat on the floor.
• Engage your core and lift one foot off the ground, balancing on the ball.
• Hold the position for 10-20 seconds, then switch feet.
• For an added challenge, try lifting both feet off the ground, balancing on the ball with your core engaged.
