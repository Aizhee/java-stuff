Bicep curls target the muscles in the front of the upper arm, helping to improve arm strength and functionality. Hold a dumbbell or household item in each hand with palms facing forward. Keep elbows close to your sides and curl the weight towards your shoulders. Lower the weight back down with control. Repeat for 10-12 reps on each arm, alternating if using one weight.
