Wall push-ups are a modified version of the traditional push-up, focusing on strengthening the chest, shoulders, and arms. Stand arm's length away from a wall, feet shoulder-width apart. Place palms flat against the wall at shoulder height. Lean forward, bending elbows to lower your chest towards the wall. Push back to starting position. Repeat for 5-10 reps, adjusting difficulty by changing distance from the wall.
