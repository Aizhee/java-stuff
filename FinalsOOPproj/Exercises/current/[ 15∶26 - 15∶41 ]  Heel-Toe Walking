Heel-toe walking is an excellent exercise for improving balance and coordination, which are essential for maintaining mobility and preventing falls, especially in older adults. By placing one foot directly in front of the other, this exercise engages the stabilizing muscles in the legs and core, enhancing overall stability. Regular practice of heel-toe walking can significantly improve your walking gait, making everyday movements safer and more efficient. This exercise can be easily performed in the comfort of your home, requiring no special equipment.
